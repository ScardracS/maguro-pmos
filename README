Actually device boot with some hack (check abootimg commands)
and turn on the screen (using weston), nothing more.

Wifi doesn't work, fixed-controllers should be ok but if you check debugfs and
compare with the downstream you'll see how much work that thing needs to be done.

Thank to @drebrez (original maintainer for the galaxy nexus),
@mis012 and @minecrell for their help and hard work.

To make things working use mms114, as the mms144 is just a patched version of the
downstream version (soo nothing good at all).

Move the i2c-gpio of touchscreen to i2c3 (as 3-0048 is the right i2c/reg for it).

On boot there are lots of bugspam, as you can see error -110 from the TS,
but checks for other ones if you want.

PS: Actually only AES2 and -2 error from TS are fixed from the version released
by @drebrez, but checks on Galaxy Nexus Wiki for more info and come to Matrix
for asking more infos.


Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
